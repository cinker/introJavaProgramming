 *  Suppose you are asked to write method that returns a pentagonal number. A pentagonal number is
 defined as n(3n–1)/2 for n  1, 2, . . ., and so on. Therefore, the first few numbers are 1, 5, 12, 22, . . .. Write a
 method with the following header that returns a pentagonal number:
 public static int getPentagonalNumber(int n)
 Write a test program that uses this method to display the first 100 pentagonal numbers with 10 numbers on each line.
